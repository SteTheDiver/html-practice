    <h1>How do I see the differences between HTML and CSS?</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>What is the difference between the usage of HTML and CSS?</li>
        <p>HTML sets the structure of a webpage while CSS it is used to style it.</p>
        <li>What is the newest version of HTML?</li>
        <p>The latest version is HTML5</p>
        <li>What are the top five most used HTML5 elements?</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Header and Footer</li>
            <li>Placeholders</li>
            <li>Email Inputs</li>
            <li>Video Support</li>
            <li>Multimedia support in HTML5</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Have you checked out the HTML5 cheatsheet?</li>
        <p>No, I should but it is difficult to find the time for everything. I know that I can find it at this <a href="https://www.wpkube.com/html5-cheat-sheet/">link</a>.</p>
        <li>What is the difference between semantic and non-semantic elements?</li>
        <p>Semantic elements are self defining their role, like "h1", "p" or "ol". On the other hand non-semantic elements have a holder and do not provide any information about the role the content they contain plays on the page.</p>
        <li>Why do we prefer using semantic elements?</li>
        <p>Because their use is immidiate.</p>
        <li>Do all browsers support all of the newest HTML / CSS elements?</li>
        <p>Partially.</p>
        <li>Test the following elements on Can I Use: svg, nav, code, form, datalist. Which browser version supports them and which do not?</li>
